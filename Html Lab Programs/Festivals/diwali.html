<h2 align="left">Diwali: The Festival of Lights</h2><br>
<p class="p">Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the most significant festivals in India and is celebrated by millions around the world. Often referred to as the "Festival of Lights," Diwali symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. The festival typically spans five days, with each day having its own unique significance and customs.</p>
<h3 align="left">Historical Significance:</h3>
<p class="p">The origins of Diwali are rooted in various legends across different cultures and religions. In Hinduism, it is commonly associated with the return of Lord Rama to his kingdom of Ayodhya after defeating the demon king Ravana, as narrated in the epic Ramayana. To celebrate his return, the people of Ayodhya illuminated the city with lamps and fireworks. In some regions, Diwali is linked to the goddess Lakshmi, the deity of wealth and prosperity, who is worshiped for blessings in the coming year.

For Jains, Diwali marks the anniversary of Lord Mahaviraâ€™s attainment of nirvana. Sikhs celebrate it as Bandi Chhor Divas, commemorating Guru Hargobind Ji's release from imprisonment. Each community celebrates Diwali with its own traditions, yet the overarching themes of light and joy remain universal.</p>
