<h2 align="left">Onam: The Festival of Harvest and Unity</h2><br>
<p class="p">Onam is a vibrant and culturally significant festival celebrated primarily in the state of Kerala, India. It usually falls in August or September and marks the beginning of the harvest season. The festival is deeply rooted in mythology and tradition, celebrating the return of the legendary King Mahabali, a beloved ruler known for his just governance and the prosperity he brought to his people.</p>
<h3 align="left">Historical Significance:</h3>
<p class="p">The origins of Onam are linked to the legend of King Mahabali, who is said to visit his subjects once a year. According to Hindu mythology, Mahabali was a powerful and benevolent demon king who ruled during a time of great prosperity. However, his increasing power threatened the gods, leading Lord Vishnu to take the form of Vamana, a dwarf Brahmin. Vamana asked Mahabali for three paces of land, which he then expanded to cover the entire universe, thus banishing Mahabali to the underworld. Before he left, Mahabali was granted permission to visit his people once a year, which is celebrated as Onam.</p>
